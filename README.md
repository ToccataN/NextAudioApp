 # Next JS Audio App
 <https://additivesynth.herokuapp.com/>

 ### A web-based additive synthesizer using Next.js, react, redux, D3, Express and the Web Audio API

 ##### The algorithm I used for adjusting frequencies for the harmonic oscillators produces a spectrum  that has a "diminished" harmonic quality to it, which I find to be aesthetically interesting. One goal for this project is to add buttons which allow the user greater control over the intervalic calculations for the harmonic spectrum, if this does not really work for them.

 ###### Dec. 31, 2018 - First prototype of this application, including basic Gain, Frequency, KeyOn control. There is also a LFO component, a crude phase shifter, and a rudimentary oscilliscope view.

 ###### Jan. 1, 2019 - Added graphical representation for harmonic oscillators. Also adpated for use with mobile. Added React-Helmet to provide meta-tag support.
